# ard-tripeptide
Bioinformatics - Molecular modelling: Tripeptide -> ACE-ALA-ARG-ASP-NME

Terminal groups: ACE (CH3CO-) and NME (-NHCH3)

Goals:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Make simulations at 298 K and 400 K following the equivalent steps detailed during the practical classes.</li>
  <li>Show the time evolution of the total and kinetic energies, the temperature of the system, two selected bond distances, two angles and two dihedrals, the radius of gyration, and the velocities of 5 different atoms . Compare the results for both temperatures.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the mean values of the kinetic energy of the system at both temperatures and compare them with the expected results from statistichal thermodynamic.</li>
  <li>Run a 500 ps simulation at 298K exporting the results every 10 fs.</li>
  <li>Plot histograms for the temperature and the three components of the velocity of a selected atom.</li>
  <li>Create Ramachandran plots for the three residues.</li>
  <li>Identify the conformations with higher probability (αR, β, ...).</li>
</ol>
